Other Google Wave Projects
==========================

Open-source
-----------
* [PyGoWave] (http://pygowave.net) - Started early June, 2009, PygoWave is my
main competitor. It offers a fuller front-end with gadgets and collaborative
editing, though it only lets you use one blip for now (as the multiblip
document model was released early November). Not federated... yet. Built using
Python, Django, Orbited, and MooTools.

Commercial
----------
* [Novell Pulse] (http://www.novell.com/products/pulse/)

	> Novell Pulse is the first enterprise class, real-time collaboration
	> platform that unites communication, authoring and social messaging tools.
	> Novell Pulse helps drive enterprise productivity and innovation by making
	> it easier to communicate digitally, generate ideas and share information.
